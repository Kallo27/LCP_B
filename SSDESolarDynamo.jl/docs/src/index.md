# SDDESolarDynamo.jl

Welcome to the documentation for **SDDESolarDynamo.jl**, a Julia module designed for simulating stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) applied to solar dynamo modeling.

## Features
- Simulate the evolution of a solar dynamo model using SDDEs.
- Analyze magnetic field properties through Fourier spectra.
- Includes summary statistics and distance functions for parameter inference.

## Getting Started
To use the module, include and import it as follows:
```Julia
include("path/to/SDDESolarDynamo.jl")
using .SDDESolarDynamo
